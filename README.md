# dotNetCayenneLppEncoderDecoder
Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) encoder an decoder (work in progress) for dotNet core, nanoFramework,and TinyCLR powered devices.

The aim is to be platform portable so I have documented the code where compromises have been made. 

Mainly netCore unit tests with selected smoke tests for nanoFramework and TinyCLR
